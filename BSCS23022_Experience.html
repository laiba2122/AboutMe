	<h2> My Experiences: </h2>
	<p>
	In my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I have been consistently driven by a passion for learning. During my time as <strong>Deputy Head Girl</strong> in AES, I played a crucial role in improving school infrastructure and student experiences. At the <strong>University of Colorado Boulder</strong>, I participated in "EducationUSA program". My journey took an exciting turn when I enrolled in "<strong>Introduction to Quantum Computing</strong>" of IBM on full scholarship. Back in Lahore, I worked with phD level reseachers of <strong>Punjab University</strong> on thin films characterization.
