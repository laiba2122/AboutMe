	<h2> My Education:</h2>
	<p>
	I spent 12 years of my life in<strong> AES</strong>, where I excelled in my <strong>O-level exams</strong> with straight As. Following this, I pursued <strong>A-levels</strong> in Math, Physics, and IT at <strong>LGS</strong> . Currently, I am doing <strong>Bachelors in Computer Science</strong> from ITU. I really love the new environment at ITU.
